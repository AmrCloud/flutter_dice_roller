# 🎲 Dice Roller App

A Flutter application that simulates realistic dice rolling, developed as part of Maxmilian Schwarzmüller's Udemy course with personal implementations.

## 📖 Overview

This project was created to help me understand fundamental Flutter concepts through practical implementation. Rather than simply following the tutorial, I focused on comprehending the concepts and developing my own version.

## 🛠 Skills Developed

Through this project, I gained understanding in:
- Core Flutter architecture and workflow
- Basic widget composition and UI building
- State management (Stateless vs Stateful widgets)
- Custom widget creation and implementation
